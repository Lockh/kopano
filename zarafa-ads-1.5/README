Zarafa AD Schema Installer for Samba 4 AD
=========================================

Using Zarafa with a Samba4 Active Directory domain controller.

At first a word of warning! Since Samba4 is still in alpha status, it is not
recommended to put it in to production use.

This software is freely distributable under the GNU public license.
For more information read "License" at the end of this README file.


Description
-----------

The script zarafa_schema_add.sh prepares and adds the Zarafa Active Directory
schema extensions to a Samba 4 Active Directory domain controller.

The two files zarafa-ads.ldf and zarafa-display-ads.ldf contain the Zarafa
schema extensions for Active Directory and are those that Zarafa ships with its
7.1.1-37812 release in zarafaads.exe. 

First of all, you will of course need Samba4. For general instructions on how
to build an configure Samba4, please refer to the excellent Samba4-HOWTO at
http://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Samba4/HOWTO

Or you could just use the SerNet samba4app
(www.enterprisesamba.com/samba4ad/samba-4-appliance).

Make sure that you got the Samba4 part right by joining a Windows workstation
to the domain and install the Windows Remote ServerAdministration Tool (RSAT)
on that workstation. You will find detailed instructions about that in the
Samba4-HOWTO, too. Make sure that you can use the Microsoft Management Console
(MMC) to administer your AD. If everything works out well here run the script
zarafa_schema_add.sh on your Samba4 server.

For the script to work, you'll need the following programms on your system: cut,
sort, tail, dos2unix, sed, head, readlink. 

Just run zarafa_schema_add.sh -h to get instructions about the correct
parameters for the installation.  The installation of the schema extension might
take several minutes. The next step is to run the zarafaads.exe on your Windows
workstation. This will install and register a dll that provides the
Zarafa-specific gui-elements in the MMC. You need to do that on every
workstation that you want to use for administration of your AD. After that you
can configure your Zarafa-server for AD-Mode.

Have fun and report your success or mishaps in the Forums.
